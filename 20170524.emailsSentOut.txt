Gareth,
    I am reaching out in reference to an escalation case ("Squid Plugin issues") that currently has an open status in our management system. Clients often have multiple regular points of contact here at AlienVault, and this sometimes leads to multiple threads being created for the same issue leaving loose ends once things get resolved under one case, or even occasional duplication of efforts. Additionally, side projects and role changes can occur rapidly in the dynamic working environment we have here, and we want to make sure that we aren't leaving issues unresolved.

    Please let us know if the matters involved in the escalation case "Squid Plugin issues" still require further assistance so that we can get a call back scheduled for you. If there's no response by Wednesday, the 31st of May, the case will be closed out. It can be reopened, if needed.

    To ensure the best quality of service, respond to this email for questions or responses specific to THIS CASE, and use one of the methods found at https://www.alienvault.com/support to contact support or file a ticket for any new or unrelated issues.
